Perfect by Ed Sheeran
I found I love for me
darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
oh, I newer knew you were
the someone waiting for me
because we were just kids
when we fell in love
not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time

Letra Can't help falling in love' by UB40
Wise, men say, only fools rush it
but I can't help falling in love with you
wise men say, only fools rush it
but I can't help falling in love whith you
shall I stay
would it be sin
cause' I can't help falling in love with you

With or without you by U2
See the stone set in your eyes
see the thorn twist in your side
I wait for you
Sleight of hand and twist of fate
on a bed of nails she makes me wait
and I wait without you
with or without you
with or without you
