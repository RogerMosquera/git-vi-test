Perfect by Ed Sheeran
I found I love for me
darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
oh, I newer knew you were
the someone waiting for me
because we were just kids
when we fell in love
not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time

Wise, men say, only fools rush it
but I can't help falling in love with you

but I can't help falling in love whith you

would it be sin
cause' I can't help falling in love with you

Letra Back for good by Take That
I guess now it's time
for me give to up,
I feel it's time,
got a picture of you beside me,
got you lipstick mark still on your coffe cup,
oh yeah,
got a first of pure emotion,
got a head of shattered dreams,
gotta leave it,
gotta leave it all behind now

With or without you by U2
See the stone set in your eyes
see the thorn twist in your side
I wait for you
Sleight of hand and twist of fate
on a bed of nails she makes me wait
and I wait without you
with or without you
with or without you

Se pidio hacer un hotfix, donde se debia separar cada letra de canciÃ³n por artista, guiones y slash.

'Stayin' Alive' by Bee Gees
well, you can tell by the way I use my walk,
I'm a woman's man: no time to talk
music loud and women warm, I've been kicked around
since I was born.
And now it's all right. It's OK
and you may look the other way
we can try to understand
the New York time's effect on man

Always on my mind by Elvis Presley
Maybe I didn't treat you
quite as good as I should have
maybe I didn't love you
quite as often as I could have
little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
you were always on my mind
you were always on my mind
